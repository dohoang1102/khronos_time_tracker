<h3 id="gettingStarted">Getting Started with Khronos</h3>

<h4 id="about">About Khronos</h4>
<p>Khronos is designed to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log time spent on each job.</li>
<li>Log time spent on each work session.</li>
<li>Calculates the payment from client (hourly wage).</li>
<li>Modify your work sessions.</li>
<li>Real time feedback.</li>
<li>Export and backup your data.</li>
<li>Print Invoices</li>
</ul>




<h4 id="editing">Editing Sessions and Jobs</h4>
<p>Here are the formats to use when editing Sessions or Jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dates: 12/12/2004 is M/D/Y</li>
<li>Times: 12:12:12 is H:M:S</li>
<li>Times can be also entered as such: 12:12:12, 12:12, 12:1212 pm, 12:12 pm</li>
<li>Rates: 12 is 12 units of currency per hour</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="importExport">Importing and Exporting Data</h4>
<h5>Exporting</h5>
<p>Exporting takes the current data and exports it. It'll save the data as a .khd file. The file is tab delineated, so feel free to import it into MS Excel or a similar program.</p>

<h5>Importing</h5>
<p>For importing, select the .khd file you want to import. Khronos will import the data. Jobs of the same name and client will display twice in Khronos. The data will not be merged, so the session data will be different, but the job and client names will exist twice.</p>

<p>You can as well import data exported from version 1.0 or 1.1. Just go to import and select the folder.</p>

<p>It's best to import files that have been directly exported from Khronos and not changed in any way.</p>


<h3 id="known">Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>Timer will continue during sleep. Make sure to "Stop Recording" before putting your computer to sleep.</li>


	<li>More improvements to come. Won't list them here since they're so sweet that we wouldn't want the competition to get a head start on us.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="donating">Donating</h3>
<p>As you might know, Khronos is free. You don't have to give us anything. It's not cripple-ware. It won't stop working in 30 days. </p>

<h5 id="how">How to Donate</h5>
<p>However, if you have the itch to get us some beer money, then you can <a href="#">donate</a> with paypal.

<h5 id="why">Why the Crap Would I Donate to You Guys?</h5>

<p>Well...</p>
<ul>
<li>We put a lot of time into it.</li>
<li>It works.</li>
<li>You want us to have a beer on you.</li>
</ul>
